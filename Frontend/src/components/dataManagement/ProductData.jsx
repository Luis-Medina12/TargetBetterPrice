It's annoying to press the main button in the control and activate the pointer. You have to be very cautious not to trigger it. 2. I liked the fireworks screensaver, but as soon as I entered my zip code the fireworks screensaver switched to a clock. I don't like it and there is no option to switch it back. 3. There is no option to set the weather units in Celsius. 4. The home screen is not intuitive at all. I mostly use apps (Netflix, Disney+, etc) and these apps are buried down and occupy a tiny portion of the screen. The user should have more freedom on how to arrange the home screen.",
